# Reactive Redux State With RxJS

The code in this repository is based on the
[Reactive Redux State With RxJS](https://ivanjov.com/reactive-redux-state-with-rxjs/)
article.

Note that I did not do the testing part that shows
how to mock http request and the store.
At some point it would be a good idea to look at this.
